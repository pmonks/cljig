# cljig

A little project intended to act as a [jig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jig_(tool)) for discovering, evaluating,
and prototyping 3rd party Clojure and Java libraries, for eventual use in your own project(s).

## Trying it Out
Clone the repo, then run:

```shell
$ clj -i init.clj -r
```

This will load some useful namespaces, display some help, the drop you in a REPL, ready to explore.
